# Evening worn checklist: 14 September 2026

Built up during the unattended session as each change is installed. Try the
items in order. Everything here was installed without a headset check; the
unattended evidence for each is in
[the session handover](../handoffs/2026-09-14-unattended-session.md).

## Installed today

1. **Nothing to see: unattended run controls** (installed with `e.g.`
   commit below). Two request files players never have:
   `darktidevr_external_viewer.flag` (the game skips starting its viewer) and
   `darktidevr_quit_game.flag` (quits through the in-game Quit route).
   Check: launch normally; the headset shows the game as before (the viewer
   still starts; console log `DARKTIDEVR_VIEWER control=start accepted`, and
   no `start=skipped`). If the headset stays dark, delete
   `mods\darktidevr\darktidevr_external_viewer.flag` if it exists.
